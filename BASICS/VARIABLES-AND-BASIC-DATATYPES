#variables are the cylinder type material that store a value of different data types like:
x = "Car"
y = 17
z = 17.3
print(x,",",y,",",z)

#There are 3 basic datatypes in Python
#1. Integer(int)
#2. Floating Point(float)
#3. String(str)

#String
a = "Python"
print(a)

#Integer
b = 33
print(b)

#Floating Point
c = 10.5
print(c)
